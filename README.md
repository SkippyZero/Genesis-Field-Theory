# Genesis Field Theory (GenFT)
### A Human–AI Assisted Exploration of Emergent Cosmology

This repository presents **Genesis Field Theory (GenFT)** — a speculative emergent cosmology framework developed through a **human-guided, AI-assisted research process**.  
The core *ideas*, *conceptual architecture*, *research direction*, and *experimental goals* were created by me.  
The *mathematical exposition*, *formal derivations*, and *scientific writing* were generated with the assistance of large-language-model AI tools under my direction and curation.

## 🔷 What This Project Is

GenFT is an exploration of:

- emergent spacetime from spectral geometry  
- a generative operator whose eigenmodes produce visible matter and dark fields  
- an arrow of time emerging from kernel condensation  
- dark-field halos built from uncondensed spectral modes  
- oscillatory features in the matter power spectrum P(k)  
- dark-field time-dilation effects  
- gravitational-wave echo phenomenology  
- rotation-curve predictions across the SPARC dataset 
- halo-based life-detection heuristics  

**This is not a validated physical theory**, but a **conceptual experiment in using AI to help formalize a new cosmological framework**.

## 🔷 Human Contribution

I contributed:

- all **core ideas**, conceptual structures, and research motivations  
- the **framework** for GenFT’s operator, kernel, and sector decomposition  
- the **halo model design**, including cored-template behavior  
- the **rotation-curve test design** (DM-only, DM+baryons, extreme DM, etc.)  
- the **life-detection scoring concept** based on halo stability  
- the **rotation-curve modeling and comparisons** across the SPARC dataset using AI-generated fitting tools
- the **curation, organization, and integration** of all documents

I directed the AI step-by-step to build the mathematical formalism and scientific language around these ideas.

## 🔷 AI Contribution

Large-language-model AI tools were used to:

- generate formal mathematical exposition  
- write proofs, derivations, and operator definitions  
- translate conceptual ideas into scientific formatting  
- draft sections of text, explanations, and terminology  
- help structure long documents and ensure internal consistency  

I do **not** claim to have independently derived every equation or mathematical detail.  
All content has been reviewed, curated, and shaped by me, but not rigorously verified.

## 🔷 Disclaimer

This project is a **speculative, exploratory exercise** in theoretical cosmology and AI-assisted scientific writing.  
Nothing here should be assumed to be:

- experimentally confirmed  
- mathematically validated  
- a replacement for standard cosmological models  

GenFT is presented as an **open-ended conceptual framework** rather than an established scientific theory.
